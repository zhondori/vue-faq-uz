# CI/CD

::: details What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery) is a technology for automating the build, testing and deployment of a project under development.

In other words, the process of transition of code lying in a repository into a working product on a cloud server, for example.

CI/CD elements are useful not only for a devops engineer, but also for a simple front-end developer, allowing him after git commit/push code changes to get a working site, for example, on GitHub Pages without additional actions.

Main tools for CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, Trevis
